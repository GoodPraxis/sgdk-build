# SGDK Vagrant and Docker setups

The following setups allow you to use [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK)
on Docker or using Vagrant.

This allows you, for instance, to build games on macOS after the Catalina update,
if you were using the [Wine setup](https://github.com/v4ld3r5/sgdk_vscode_template)
beforehand (Catalina does not support 32-bit anymore).

You can also build your roms using a CI. We have [an example](https://github.com/GoodPraxis/docker-retroarch)
where we build a rom and test it using Retroarch by producing a screenshot
of the result.
